					<p>	
						Amsterdam also has the largest dance festival in the world: 'Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE)'
						attracting around 350.000 people from all over the world.
						Amsterdam is also known for its diversity. There are about 180 nationalities in Amsterdam
						making Amsterdam the second most diverse city (no pun intended) with New York City
						taking the lead.It is also known as the Capital of the Netherlands because there's a 
						Royal palace right on top of the Dam Square. This is defined in the Dutch Constitution,
						but the government itself has moved to Den Haag and thus Amsterdam is a capital without
						a government residing. quite unique, isn't it?
