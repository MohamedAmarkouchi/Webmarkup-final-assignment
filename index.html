						Amsterdam also has the largest dance festival in the world: 'Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE)'
						attracting around 350.000 people from all over the world.
						Amsterdam is also known for its diversity. There are about 180 nationalities in Amsterdam
						making Amsterdam the second most diverse city (no pun intended) with New York City
						taking the lead.It is also known as the Capital of the Netherlands because there's a 
						Royal palace right on top of the Dam Square. This is defined in the Dutch Constitution,
						but the government itself has moved to Den Haag and thus Amsterdam is a capital without
						a government residing. quite unique, isn't it?

				<h2> Bos & lommer </h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>
				Bos & Lommer was considered a problematic neighbourhood, so the municipality invested more money and paid more attention towards Bos & Lommer to take care if her current situation.
				within a few years Bos & lommer became a beautiful place with various activities to do.
				
				For instance you can visit the Candy Castle, known as the former st. Josephkerk, together with your children, cousins or friends
				to have some fun and playtime together with other children visiting the place aswell. For an &euro;8,- fee, you can enter the place for the whole day. And if you pay them a visit on Monday, Tuesday or Thursday
				after 4PM, this fee is reduced to &euro;5,50.

				Are you more a lover of nature?
				If you want, you can also pay a visit to the beautiful Erasmuspark located at the Jan van Galenstraat. The parc is patrolled during the whole day and is secured with doors which are locked during the nightime.
				this is done so it can be a safe and clean place to go to and enjoy the visit. You can go play some sports there or just have a picknick. all your decision for your visting purpose.

				Ofcourse if you like to go shopping, there is also 'Bos en Lommerplein Markt'. It is a big square with a huge variety of market stalls. The atmospheric is very nice there and the people are all kind to eachother.
				Bos en Lommer is a very multicultural neighbourhood, so blending in with all the people won't be really difficult.
				
				Bos en Lommer is easy accessible with the public transport. You can go with bus or tram, even if you was with your car, but keep in mind that it is hard to find a free parking zone.
				Once in Bos en Lommer, you are surrounded by various stores and restaurants. go shopping, or go grab a bite. Maybe you want to go there for touring purposes.
				If the weather is nice, there are lots of café with a terrace where you can grab a drink and relax. For example at the Florya restaurant/café, which is a floating café on water at the Erasmusgracht.
